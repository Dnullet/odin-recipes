This project is intended to demonstrate my basic command over HTML and the use of a github repository. It is a simple multi-page website set up from scratch done mostly from memory and includes the following HTML features: headings, paragraphs,bold and italic type, ordered and unordered lists, aboslute and relative links, and images. The content is derived from the Talisman Italian Cook Book. The home page will list the names of the recipes, which will link to a separate page that includes the given recipe.
